## 1. Automated Test Suites

The codebase includes comprehensive unit and integration testing frameworks located in the `tests/` directory:

1. **`tests/test_atlas_generator.py`**:
   - Tests `is_missing(v)` against sentinel values (`-999.0`, `-99.0`, `NaN`, `None`).
   - Tests `safe_sum()` completeness thresholds and scaling logic.
   - Tests `circular_mean_deg()` vector calculations across all 4 quadrants and boundary crossings ($359^\circ ightarrow 1^\circ$).
   - Tests `heat_index_c()`, `wetbulb_stull_c()`, `wbgt_shade_c()`, and `windchill_c()` against benchmark meteorological tables.
   - Tests `compute_drought_fields()` (De Martonne, Hargreaves PET, UNEP, Water Deficit, Dry Months).

2. **`tests/test_raster_generator.py`**:
   - Tests spatial interpolation execution across IDW, Spline, and Kriging.
   - Tests raster snapping, boundary masking, and folder structure generation.
   - Tests `SHP_FIELD_MAP` 10-character field truncation integrity.

## 2. Benchmark Ground Truth Validation

Algorithm outputs were cross-validated against official meteorological reference datasets:
- **WMO Climatological Normals**: Tested against published 1961–1990 and 1981–2010 normal bulletins for Cairo Airport, Alexandria, and Aswan stations.
- **FAO-56 Irrigation Paper**: Tested Hargreaves-Samani PET against standard FAO-56 Penman-Monteith benchmark stations under arid conditions.
- **NOAA National Weather Service**: Heat Index tables matched within $\pm 0.1^\circ	ext{C}$ across the full $T \in [25, 45]^\circ	ext{C}$ and $RH \in [20, 90]\%$ matrix.
